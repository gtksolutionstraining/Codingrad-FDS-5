Robustness of the Software.

Exception Handling is a software principle which will make your software more robust.

The situation encountered by a wierd input to the software is called Exception.

If This Exception is not handled then its called Crash

If this Exception is handled then its Exception Handling -> More Robust.

Exception Handling:
    1. Try Block
    2. Catch Block

1. Try Block: 
    --> We know Exception then Add Exception code in a block called Try Block
    --> If we dont get any wierd input then Try Block will execute smoothly.
    --> If we get a weird input then Try Block will raise an Exception.
    --> In a single Try block you can have multiple statements which can raise exceptions.
    --> For each exception we need handle different way.

2. Catch Block:
    --> Catch Block Catches the respective Exception raised by the Try Block
    --> We will write the code to handle such Exception


Exception is a Folder
    1. ValueError
    2. IndexOutofBound
    3. ...


Note: Exception Precedence.
    ==> All specific Exception should be handled first and then the main Exception can be handled.
