We can use Python Interpreter as a basic Calculator

Tasks --> Is a programm which takes an input and do some logic and give u an doutput.

A Programm which takes a number and so sqrt operation and gives a sqrt of the given number. --> Function

Most of the mathematical operations have already defined functions

--> Collection of utilities is called a module.


By default --> Python will provide some inbuild modules.
    1. math --> It will provide utilities related to mathematical operations
    2. os   --> It will provide utilites related to operating system commands --> mkdir, cd, create_file, listing directory
    3. json
    4. sys --> Raw provision for operating system
    6. importlib --> 

Custom Modules --> 3rd party modules
    1. pandas 
    2. numpy
    3. scikit-learn
    4. scipy
    5. tensorflow
    6. pytorch
    7. dask
    8. ydata-profiling
    9. dataprep.eda
    10. matplotlib
    11. opencv
