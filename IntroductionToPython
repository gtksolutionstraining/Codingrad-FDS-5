1. Python Open Source Language
2. Python Large Community
3. APIs --> Application Programming Interface
4. AWS
5. Infrastructure as Code --> IaC 
    1. Terraform
    2. Python --> AWS CDK --> Cloud Formation
6. XYZ
7. All Data Science and Machine Learning Libraries
8. Automation Projects

==> Python Programming
1. Interpreted Language
--> High Level Languages --> Easily Readable and Understandable languages
--> Low Level Languages --> Assembly Language, C/C++
--> High Level Language -----------------------> Binary 0/1

--> Transformation methods: 
    1. Compilation
    2. Interpretation
    3. Hybrid

Compilation --> Whole Code will be compiled once and convert the whole to code Binary
Interpretation --> 
    1. Compilation Time --> Code --> Binary 
    2. Execution Time --> Binary --> CPU 
    3. Total Time = Compilation Time + Execution Time

C/C++ --> Compilation Languages
    1. Compilation time is more --> Execution time is very very fast
    2. Platform Dependent Languages
Python --> Interpretation Language
    1. Transformation Time is less --> Execution time is vere very slow

Java --> Hybrid Language
    1. Java Code --> Compile --> Byte Code 
    ** JVM
    2. Binary Code --> Interpret (line by line execute)
