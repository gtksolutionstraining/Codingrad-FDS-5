The focus on software development is around the data rather around the functions.

OOPs:
1. Class
2. Object


1. Class: Class is a blueprint/Description/Logical Entity

Describing about an Entity through its properties and actions is called Class.

A class is blueprint of an entity

All classes logical entities.

2. Object: Object is an instance of a class/ Physical Entities.
3. Member Variables: Member Variables are the properties of the class --> 
4. Member Methods: Member Methods are the actions defined in the class. 

Define Human.


**Constructor**: Constructor will instantiate an object.

. ==> Membership Operator.

1. Default Constructor
    -> Every class will have a default constructor.
2. Constructors with no parameters
3. Constructors with parameters
4. Copy Constructures

Constructor Overloading --> Python doesn't support it.

Abstraction(ADT): Data hiding

Access Specifiers: ==> Private Protected Public

__ ==> Access Specifier for Private
_ ==> Acess Specifier for Protected

Encapsulation: Binding Member Variables and Member functions
