# LMS -> Library Management System

Problem Statement: Now a days managing users, and books in library is a very hectic process. Everytime new user comes in we need to add in the book, and adding and deleting books that are present in the library *manually*. 

Proposed Solution: 
    1. We will be using basic functional programming style
    2. We will be using traditional file handling using json for the database management
    3. We will be giving Console access to the users.

Technical Stack:
    1. Python 
    2. Dictionary (Maps)
    3. JSON Files
