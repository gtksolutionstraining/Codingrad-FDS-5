Data Structuring: Is an engineering approach to effciently store and manipulate the data.
    1. Data Structures
        1. All primitive data types
            int,float,string,character,boolean
        2. Array
        3. Stacks
        4. Queues
        5. LinkedLists --> List
        6. Hashing --> Hashmap --> dictionary
        7. Tree
        8. Graph

List is an ordered collection of elements of any type 

Array --> Is a continuous memory allocation of same datatype

    Array Initial address --> 1000B
    Every element integer --> 4B

    location address --> inital_address + (location-1)*size of the data type

    5th location address --> 1000B + (4)*4B => 1004B


Accessing Time Complexity for 'n' of elements
    1. List --> O(n)
    2. Array --> O(1)

Insertion Time Complexity for 'n' of elements
    1. List --> O(1)
    2. Array --> O(n)

Array -->Accessing Time is O(1) and also Insertion Time as O(n)
List -->Insertion Time is O(1) and Accessing Time is O(n)

Hashmap/Dictionary --> Accessing Time is O(1) and Insertion Time is also O(1)
                              O(logn)                         O(logn)
